    Officially I started my degree two years ago, but my path with engineering started back when I was a kid playing with legos wanting to build more. From there I’ve had the privilege of participating in competitive robotics from elementary school to today, picking up new skills along the way.

    Through various job shadows, an internship at 
      <a href="https://www.swoboda.com/en/company/locations/grand-rapids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swoboda</a> 
    the summer before college, and lots of advice from peers, I choose <strong>Industrial and Operations Engineering</strong> as my field of study. It allows me to face a variety of difficult and unique problems and equips me with the tools to solve them. Its versatility and broad applications in many industries made it the perfect choice.

    This past summer, I had the opportunity to work at 
      <a href="https://www.lanl.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Alamos National Labratory</a>
    , working with analytical chemists and nuclear scientists to develop a panel system to improve 
      <span>isotope separation processes<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope_separation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a></sup></span>
    taking place inside of 
      <span>hot cell chambers<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_cell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2</a></sup></span>
    . I am still working part time with LANL helping expand the library of 3D printed parts that work with the panel system I designed. You can find more information about my summer internship
